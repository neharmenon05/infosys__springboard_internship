# Quantum Policy Assistant (Infosys Internship Project)

This repository was created as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship (Batch 3, Team 1)**. 
It demonstrates how **machine learning**, **policy datasets**, and **quantum-inspired techniques** can be combined to build an intelligent assistant for exploring and analyzing public policies.


## Key Features
- **Policy Dataset Integration** — Includes structured CSV dataset (`policies.csv`)  
- **Machine Learning Models** — Scripts and saved models for policy classification and retrieval  
- **Quantum-Inspired Search** — Experimental module for enhanced similarity scoring  
- **Web Application** — Application logic under `app/` for serving results  
- **Extensible Design** — Modular structure for adding new models or datasets

## Dataset Format
The included `policies.csv` file is structured with fields such as:

```
policy_id,title,full_text,state,year,category,status,region
1,Education Reform Act,Full text of the policy...,Delhi,2021,Education,Active,North
```
