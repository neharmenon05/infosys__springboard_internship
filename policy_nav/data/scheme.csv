This women welfare scheme is facing criticism on its naming after Nandamuri Basavatarakam who was no way associated with the state government. 
The primary cause of the stay order is that the state govt. invites “Tenders” by fixing a price tag of each kit at Rs. 1,038. Another company has come forward to provide kits at lower cost than its competitors. However, the company which quoted the higher amount is being given the tender for some undisclosed reasons.

Background – Need for Wage Compensation Scheme in Assam
The state govt. has decided to launch this scheme because the maternal mortality rate of women in tea plantations of Assam is very high. In the annual health survey 2012-13, the state has one of the highest mortality rates. This includes around 300 maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births.

In addition to this, around 50% of pregnant women between 15 to 49 years of age are anaemic which contributes to higher maternal mortality. The bulk of workforce enrolled in tea growing areas of Assam is women.

शक्ति स्वरूपा योजना 2019 (Chhattisgarh Shakti Swarupa Yojana) को शुरू करने के पीछे छत्तीसगढ़ सरकार का यही मकसद है की राज्य की निराश्रित और बेसहारा महिलाएं ज्यादा से ज्यादा आत्म निर्भर बन सके। क्यूंकि विधवा होने के बाद महिलाओं को समाज में ठीक से जगह नहीं मिलती और उनकी आर्थिक स्थिति भी खराब हो जाती है। छत्तीसगढ़ की शक्ति स्वरूपा योजना महिलाओं को व्यवसाय के क्षेत्र में आने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करेगी।

As per the official statement, health services should be the right of citizens such as Right to Information, Right to Work, Right to Food, so UHS needs to be implemented in Chhattisgarh.
The newly elected govt. in the state of Chhattisgarh has made pre-poll promise of launching CG Universal Healthcare Scheme. Now the state govt. said that the UHS Scheme is in pipeline for the citizens to replace PMJAY Scheme. This move will make the state the 1st state in the country to implement universal healthcare scheme. 
TS Singh Deo stated that the new universal healthcare scheme of Chhattisgarh is better than the Ayushman Bharat – PM Jan Arogya Yojana.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Chhattisgarh Universal Healthcare Scheme (UHS) 2019
The state govt. of Chhattisgarh is going to launch Universal Healthcare Scheme (UHS) 2019. This scheme is essential as Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PMJAY) is an insurance-based model. In PMJAY Scheme, tax payers money is given to the insurance companies. In the insurance company based model of implementation, there are some irregularities. The state govt. will provide quality healthcare to people on the basis of their infrastructure through UHS Scheme.
TS Singh Deo has made allegation that treatment of only Rs. 50,000 is covered in Ayushman Bharat Scheme instead of Rs. 5 lakh. In Ayushman Bharat Yojana, OPD treatment of the citizens is not covered and to avail benefits, people needs to get admitted in the hospital for insurance cover. Accordingly, around 70% of the citizens are not covered in this Ayushman Bharat Scheme. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

In Chhattisgarh, UHS scheme only covers Rs. 50,000 and expenses above the limit is provided by the state government. In the tender, there was a premium amount of Rs. 1100 out of which Rs. 660 is paid by the central govt. while the remaining cost is borne by the state government. UHS scheme can be implemented with the existing infrastructure.

Addressed the gathering during the National Convention on Health For All, organised in Raipur, elucidating upon the various new healthcare schemes introduced by Congress Govt and discussing the varied aspects of Universal Healthcare Scheme in pipeline for Chhattisgarh. pic.twitter.com/f94dROu1oc
— TS Singh Deo (@TS_SinghDeo) March 14, 2019

Universal Healthcare Scheme needs no more infrastructure to provide quality treatment to citizens. The state govt. can provide better healthcare facilities with the current 170 community health centers. Moreover as the requirement for health services increases, the state govt. can increase it with requirement. Every village is being covered by the health workers and has given assurance to provide further assistance.
PM Narendra Modi has inaugurated the first health care center under PMJAY Scheme at Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh on 14 April 2018. PMJAY Scheme aims to provide free secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to around 50 crore poor people. The PMJAY beneficiaries includes poor and vulnerable families including rural families and identified occupational categories of urban workers families. Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to provide Rs. 5 lakh annual coverage per family for secondary and tertiary healthcare at public and empanelled private hospitals.

Under the scheme, the beneficiaries will get high-quality saplings of bamboo from the government free of cost. Villagers can plant these bamboo saplings in their farms and nearby areas. Besides this, information and guidelines for implanting and production will also be provide to the villagers at free of cost so that the demand of bamboo could be fulfilled in the upcoming years.

Bamboo is known as Poor Man’s Timber which is used to construct many daily purpose things like basket and chairs etc. Bamboo is a strong timber used for many purposes. Besides this, it is an eco-friendly option because its plants releases 30 percent more oxygen compared to the other plants species.
Under the Mukhyamantri Baans Baadi Yojana, every year 5 to 50 high quality bamboos sapling will be transferred to the backyards of houses in villages and other area. This will help to achieve the demand of bamboo with the ample supply from villages and thereby, dependence on forest department for the same would minimize. The initiative will help villagers earn extra income. Besides the assurance of sufficient supply of bamboo in next couple of years, the scheme will also financially strengthen the bamboo craftsmen families.

Bamboo will play an important role in catalyzing Prime Minister’s initiative to double the income of farmers. Fast growing variety of bamboo saplings such as Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa tulda, Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus asper and saplings of other bamboo species of tissue culture will also be provided to the villagers for plantation.
The scheme will cover all the districts including places with low bamboo production and special tribal area. The preference will be given to the area on the basis of population of bamboo craftsman families.
Mukhyamantri Baans-Baadi Yojana is not yet launched hence information on this page is tentative.

Just like installation of CCTV cameras in Delhi, the state govt. will follow the same process to install street lights. The street lights will even be put outside people houses under Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana 2019 in Delhi.
The new scheme of installation of street lights by Delhi government will bypasses the role of the MCD. CM Street Light Scheme will provide solution to problems which people faces in dark stretches in the city.

Delhi CM Street Light Scheme 2019
The three Discoms of Delhi will have the responsibility for installation and maintenance of street lights. Under Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana, the installation would be of 20 to 40 Watt LED lights. The tender process for Delhi CM Street Light Scheme 2019 will also include a warranty clause of 3 to 5 years. CM Street Light Yojana will have an investment of Rs. 100 crore for installation of street lights and Rs. 10 crore per annum subsequently.
The state govt. of Delhi is committed to ensure that not even a single dark spot is left in the state. All the lights installed under CM Street Light Scheme will be automatic and will even contain sensors. People would be able to submit their requests for street lights to their local MLAs. After placing requests, the permission of building owners will be taken. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Upon receiving permission, the street lights will get installed after the location of survey is passed by the power company. It is expected that the selection process for location of street lights will be completed before November 2019. The building owner’s household connection will power the street lights. 
The state govt. of Delhi will decide how much electricity is needed to run 1 light. The same electricity cost will be deducted from electricity bills of people as it is an automatic arrangement. Delhi CM Street Light Scheme will ensure that the entire state is covered with street lights. In unauthorized colonies and slum areas, there was lack of space and MCDs were refusing to give NOCs to setup street lights. To tackle this issue, the state govt. has launched Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana.
Now with the launch of this CM Street Light Scheme, only the permission of MLA and building owner would be required. People can now get these lights installed outside their house, shop and street. Till date, there are around 7 lakh street lights in Delhi and now 2 lakh more street lights will be installed. Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana is the first plan in the world in which tender of 30% of current street light capacity is being launched.

All those people who consumes between 200 to 400 units per month would be given 50% subsidy on electricity bills. This is to be done under Delhi Free Lifeline Electricity Scheme by providing additional funds to power sector.
CM Arvind Kejriwal announced that the state govt. will spend Rs. 1800 to 2200 crore per annum for the subsidy on electricity. In Delhi, there are around 4.9 million domestic power consumers and most of these people would be benefited. In this Electricity Bill Waiver Scheme, there would be zero power bills on consumption upto 200 units.
This move of providing free electricity to Delhiites will cover at-least 33% consumers whose usage is less than 200 units in summer.

Delhi Free Lifeline Electricity Scheme
The state govt. of Delhi will provide free electricity to all those people whose per month consumption is less than 200 units. Till date, Delhi has the cheapest electricity in the country and this Free Lifeline Electricity Scheme will provide additional relief to Aam Aadmi in the city. Previously in 2012, CM Kejriwal had launched Bijli Satyagraha as an activist over the inflated bills received by a labourer.
Delhi govt. has taken this decision to provide free electricity one day after the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) also reduced the burden on consumers. DERC has reduced fixed charges for most domestic connections by up to 84%.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

DERC has kept the energy charges same for all categories, except for those who consume more than 1,200 units per month. Any family in Delhi which consumes more than 1200 units electricity in a month will now have to pay 25 paise extra per unit and will be charged Rs. 8 per unit. As per the statement “Those in Delhi who consume up to 200 units of electricity do not need to pay their electricity bills. They will get a zero electricity bill.” 
Earlier, people used to pay Rs. 622 for 200 units electricity which is now free. For 250 units power per month, people used to pay Rs. 800 which will now get reduced to Rs. 252. For 300 units, people used to pay Rs 971 but now they will pay only Rs. 526. For 400 units, they used to pay Rs 1320, now they’ll pay Rs 1075.

This new scheme of Delhi govt. will enable students to get knowledge about leadership skills and will turn them into entrepreneurs. The main focus is to make students job creators rather than job seekers.

Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum 2019
The new move of the Delhi govt. to provide Rs. 5,000 per year to government college students will encourage students to start business ventures. In order to turn them into entrepreneurs, students would be taught to take risk in business. If only 1% of government school / college students goes on to become entrepreneurs, then India will surely become a superpower. Previously, the state government had introduced happiness curriculum which is often praised by the foreign delegates.
The Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum is also going to have the same impact. Ironically, the state govt. is providing degree to students but whenever there is a clerk job, hundreds of PhD scholarship makes online registrations and apply for that jobs. This situation arises only due to the lack of knowledge and the students are unable to figure out what is best suitable for them.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The entire country is suffering from the lack of employment opportunities and with each passing day, the number of job seekers are increasing rather than job creators. All the school children wants to get jobs rather then becoming employment generators. This thought process can be solved by the new Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum.
Delhi govt. is consistently working hard to create more employment opportunities which is the true patriotism. This new entrepreneurship curriculum will help children let their fear go and do something creative in order to eventually create jobs for thousands of people. 
The state govt. is going to allocate upto Rs. 50 crore in the budget in the next financial year in order to enable students to get seed money to generate new ideas of business plan. Any entrepreneur is the person who believes in themselves and has ability to gather resources and solve problems. 
The new Entrepreneurship Curriculum is not going to focus on any business or job oriented skill. However, this curriculum will equip learners with a mindset to help choose any profession they want to get in.

Goa Revised Cyberage Student Scheme 2018-19
Cyberage scheme in Goa was introduced in FY 2002 by Manohar Parrikar during his 1st term in office. This was the first scheme across the country where laptops were being provided absolutely free to students of higher secondary schools and professional colleges. Later this scheme was upgraded to provide laptops to students. Till date, all the students in class XI are entitled to get free laptops. But it is proposed that class XI students of the academic year 2018-19 will receive laptops under the revised cyberage student scheme.
The implementation of new free laptop scheme may take some time as various revised scheme related details are yet to be finalised. This revised cyberage scheme 2018-19 would include the provisions for students liability if the laptop provided by the schools to him / her is damaged while in the possession of the students.

Accordingly, govt. will have to pay a higher premium to the insurance companies every year. Till date, the state govt. was paying an annual premium of Rs. 35 crore which is likely to go upto Rs. 80 crore.

For installation of solar panels, farmers will only have to pay 5% of the total cost. Central & State govt. will provide subsidy of 60% while for the rest 35%, the state govt. will provide low cost loans to the farmers for 7 years.
Farmers can generate power through these solar panels and can sell it to the state government. Govt. will procure electricity at a rate of Rs. 7 per unit for 7 years while at Rs. 3.50 for the remaining 18 years. SKY scheme is expected to cover 12,400 farmers in 33 districts and will provide them with solar power through 137 feeders. 
Latest Update – Gujarat CM launches the ambitious Suryashakti Kisan Yojana on 19 October 2018, a power harvesting scheme for Gujarat farmers from Bardoli. This scheme enables farmers to generate electricity by installing solar panels in their farms for their captive consumption and also earn from selling the surplus power.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Initially, the state govt. will implement the pilot project of solar power generation scheme with an outlay of Rs. 870 crore. To produce 1,42,000 horse power of energy for irrigation through water pumps will require 177 megawatts of solar power generation in the pilot stage.
Suryashakti Kisan Yojana – SKY Scheme in Gujarat
The state govt. has launched the pilot project and will implement this scheme soon in the entire state. Farmers will get included in the next phase. The main aim is to harness the solar energy and to put it in use to generate power. Now farmers can generate electricity and utilize it for irrigation purpose and sell the additional energy via grid. The important features and highlights of this scheme are as follows:- 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});


Solar Panels Purchase Cost – Out of the total cost, farmers will only have to pay 5%. 60% would be given as subsidy amount while 35% would be given as low interest rate loans for 7 years. The loan repayment time is fixed at 7 years.
Selling Additional Power – Farmers can sell the additional power to state government. For first 7 years, govt. will purchase power at a cost of Rs. 7 per unit while govt. will purchase the power at Rs. 3.5 per unit for next 18 years.
This scheme will provide a huge relief to the farmers and will also generate additional income. Farmers will be able to recover the cost of investment within the next 8 to 18 months.
Till date, farmers are getting electricity for 8 hours for irrigation purpose. After the successful implementation of this project, farmers will get electricity upto 12 hours. Moreover, it will also resolve the concerns of farmers of getting power supply only at night.
Extra Earnings for the Govt. – Currently, farmers in Gujarat pay around 50 paise / unit for electricity supply for irrigation purposes. The state government spends about Rs. 4,500 – 5,000 crore per year as subsidy on electricity for irrigation purpose. This subsidy cost can be brought down by proper implementation of SKY Scheme.

The intention of the state govt. is clearly to help people facing road accidents anywhere in Gujarat.

Road Accident Victim Compensation Scheme in Gujarat
The important features and highlights of this reimbursement scheme are as follows:-

Any victim of road accidents can avail free treatment in any govt. or private hospitals in the state.
All the expenses upto Rs. 50,000 of each of the accident victims in the first 48 hours in any hospital will be reimbursed by the state govt.
Along with Gujarat residents, people from other states and even from other countries facing accidents in Gujarat are also applicable for this scheme. Even there is no income criteria attached with this scheme.
The primary objective is to provide timely and best quality treatment to the victims in order to reduce the life risk as first 48 hours are crucial for accident victims.
This scheme will also change the intention of people to shift victims immediately in a govt. hospital which sometimes does not have the quality treatment facilities. Now, people can admit such victims directly into the nearby hospital (either private or govt.) with specialist doctors and other required facilities without caring about expenses.
Ambulance Operators will also be given directions to admit road accident victims in the best hospitals near the location of the place where accident took place.
Private hospitals will not charge upto Rs. 50,000 money for the first 48 hours from the accident victims instead they will get this amount reimbursed from the state govt.

Gujarat govt. is going to implement this scheme as soon as possible. In Gujarat, around 29,300 accidents take place every year out of which around 6,400 results in death of patients.

Providing best possible treatment in a timely manner will help in saving many lives. For this reason, govt. will provide instructions to the private hospitals to start giving free treatment and submit their bills with the officials for reimbursement.

No further testing of the meter and investigation will be done in their case.

This is the next major move after 3 settlement schemes for loanee farmers of cooperative banks.
The state govt. decided to provide relief to tubewell consumers having electricity connections under Surcharge Waiver Scheme & plot holders of HSVP. There are around 6.10 lakh farmers in the Haryana state which have taken electricity connections for the tubewells. 
Out of these farmers, around 2.44 lakh connections have become defaulters and an amount of Rs. 147 crore is outstanding towards them.

Haryana Surcharge Waiver on Tubewells Electricity Bills
In this new Tubewell Surcharge Waiver Scheme in Haryana, if farmers wants to pay their electricity bills then no surcharge amount would be deducted. Previously, farmers had to pay surcharge amount of 20% to 25% of the power bills of tubewells. The surcharge amount would now be waived in case farmers make lump-sum payment of their bils upto 30 November 2019.
Moreover, Tubewells electricity connections of farmers which have been discontinued for less than 2 years on becoming defaulters would be restored. On Enhancement Recalculation Scheme, CM said that earlier plot holders does not gets information on enhancement by HSVP. Due to this, interest on the enhancement amount gets increased.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Previously in July 2018, a 1 time settlement plan with 40% rebate was launched for HSVP plot holders. Under that settlement plan, over 24,000 plot holders deposited around Rs. 853 crore as enhancement amount. In November 2019, another settlement scheme was launched with 37.5% rebate. In that scheme, over 4,000 plot holders paid an enhancement of Rs. 155 crore.
But till date, some plot holders have not paid their enhancement amount even in the previous 2 settlement schemes. The major demand of such plot holders was that the recalculation of enhancement must be done in their sectors. So, the state govt. has made new rules and a separate committee was constituted for recalculation. 
As per the recommendations of this committee, govt. has to perform recalculation of 300 sectors out of which calculation of 12 sectors has already been done. Now all the plot holders are required to deposit the enhancement amount as per this recalculation. As per the new rules, recalculation of each sector is going to be different. So, the plot holders are expected to get benefit ranging from 9% to 45%.

For the first time in the state, all the 4 power companies have emerged from losses and have earned profit. In 2017-18, UHBVN earns a profit of Rs. 278 crore and DHBVN earns profit of Rs. 134 crore. Thus the total earned profits of these 2 companies is Rs. 412 crore. To ensure welfare of farmers, the power tariff has been reduced to almost half (50%).

In this scheme, the state govt. will provide support of Rs 100/quintal to small and marginal farmers who have not burned stubble in their fields. This amount would only be applicable to non Basmati paddy procured by government. Stubble incentives would be provided through deputy commissioner.
The number of Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme beneficiaries and estimated cost will be known after CM’s clearance. As per an estimate, around 20 lakh farmers in Haryana cultivate on less than 5 acres of land. The government has information of land and bank accounts of all the farmers. The proposal to curb stubble burning is sent to CM Manohar Lal Khattar who will take final decision in this regard.
Supreme Court has lashed out at authorities for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region. SC had directed the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide support of Rs 100/quintal within seven days to farmers for not burning stubble.

Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme to Curb Stubble Burning
Parali (Stubble) burning has become a major cause of pollution in recent days. Many farmers in Haryana and Punjab burns their stubble in order to get their farm land ready for next season cultivation. The smoke emission from parali burning contains pollutants and is choking nearby state Delhi. The NCT of Delhi is just like gas chamber these days due to harmful levels of Air Quality Index (AQI). 
PM 2.5 & PM 10 levels in national capital are beyond hazardous level due to parali burning. SC has already put a ban on burning of stubble in these 2 states, but the no. of incidents of stubble burning are not reducing. This is because farmers are poor in both Haryana and Punjab states. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The parali machine price is not affordable as it costs around 15 lakh per machine even after getting subsidy from central govt. Moreover, the rent of parali machine is too high for farmers which they cannot afford. So to reduce the level of pollution in Delhi, Supreme Court has ordered Punjab and Haryana state govt’s to provide incentives to farmers.

At a function organized here to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, CM said that single use plastic (disposable) is not only an environment hazard but also a health threat for humans and animals. 
This scheme will encourage people to use environment-friendly bags instead of polythene. HP state govt. has already imposed ban on usage of plastic bags and cutlery made of plastic and thermocol. Jute bags are an alternative to plastic bags.

There is a need to adopt Gandhiji’s humanistic message and ideology in life. This year, the state govt. celebrates 150th birth anniversary of Father of Nation as “Swachhata Hi Seva” campaign. On 2 October 2019, the state govt. also celebrates the day to perform “Shramdaan” to eradicate plastic waste.
Himachal Pradesh is the first state to tackle the threat of plastic and other non-biodegradable waste. The polythene waste collected through various awareness campaigns would be used as an alternative in road construction and as fuel in cement kilns.

Till date, there is a tedious task of waiving off Rs. 46,000 crore farm loan from nationalized and cooperative banks. For this purpose, CM has created a separate cell and even appointed an IAS officer to work on this for 24 hours. CM office (CMO) is consistently tracking the progress on a daily basis and is working effectively to ensure that loan waiver benefits reaches every farmer across the state.
Till 11 January 2019, the farm loan waiver has already reached around 1,70,000 farmers and the state govt. has already released Rs. 900 crore. In the 1st Budget, the state govt. has allocated Rs. 9,000 crore for loan waiver scheme in the first year. By 31 January 2019, approx. 11 to 12 lakh farmers will get the loan waiver benefits. CM said that a comparison should be made between the farm loan waiver schemes of various states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh. Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme is surely a role model as the farmers got benefited in a lesser time span.
The state govt. was holding discussions with the nationalized banks, and the govt. was expecting some relaxation in the backdrop of one time settlement plan. Out of the Rs. 9,500 crore loan waiver details of the cooperative banks that the state govt. has, some were false claims. According to the guidelines, farmers needs to submit some documents in order to find out the people who are misusing it and to eliminate them. Karnataka Farm Loan Waiver Scheme implementation is the biggest achievement of the state government so far.

SC / ST students who have cleared Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), Scholastic Aptitude / Assessment Test (SAT) and other qualifying examinations are eligible for Prabuddha Scheme.
Background for Prabhudha Scheme
Though there was funding for SC/ST students to study abroad since 2001, only 287 students have availed benefits till 2018. This is because the students with 49% to 51% score in qualifying exams like GRE / GMAT / SAT were funded. The state government had spent around Rs. 58 crore under the Prabuddha scheme so far. This is a pioneering move and the Prabhudha scheme will enable students from depressed classes to realize their dream.
Access to education for SC / ST is limited due to lack of funds and social pressures. With this Prabuddha scheme, govt. wants that more students can avail scheme benefit and contribute towards improving their own lives as well as the communities from where they comes from and of the entire state.
The scholarship funds would be distributed equally to ensure that the scheme remains fair and transparent to all applicants. A student is eligible to apply for the scheme for 1 time only whether it is for UG, PG or PhD courses. From a single family, maximum 2 students can apply for the scholarship scheme. This scheme will realize the dream of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar of an enlightened India, Prabhuddha Bharat and would enable students to broaden their horizons for the betterment of the society.

But now the Selfie With Toilet Scheme is compulsory for all grooms and brides to avail Rs. 51,000 as marriage gift.
There is nothing wrong in attaching photo of groom in toilet as it is not a part of wedding card. This case gets worse in case the bride lives in another city or district. The local govt. officials did not approves the marriage till groom provided proof of him standing in toilet. The toilets are an intrinsic part of Swachh Bharat Mission of central government.

Now, all the buyers (traders) will not be able to purchase onions at less than Rs. 800 per quintal. Moreover, traders who buy farmers for price higher than Rs. 800 per quintal and sell onions in Mandis outside the state will get 75% grant of expenditure on transport and storage.
In addition to this, in case the state co-operative marketing committees or agricultural producers organization sell the onion purchased from farmers outside the MP state, then such organizations would get cent percent compensation of cost of transport and storage.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Despite all these efforts, in case all prices fall below Rs. 800 per quintal in the market in May and June months, then the difference amount b/w model selling price of fixed mandis and support price of Rs. 800 / quintal would be directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers. To avail this difference amount, farmers must be registered and must have sell onions during this period alone.
CM Kamal Nath urges all the farmers to not to bring their entire onion for sale in market. This is because as the farmers brings their entire produce in the market, then it causes unnecessary pressure on onion prices (price fall). So, farmers must only sell onions of the amount which they require at the time of arrival of crop. Accordingly, farmers can simply store the remaining produce of onions. This move will not have any impact on the prices of onions in the Mandis and the farmers will get fair prices of their crop.

This CIDCO lucky draw 2019 would be a part of the Prime Minister’s flagship “Housing For All (HFA) by 2022” scheme. All the affordable houses would be sold through lottery by July end or August 2019.
All the flats under CIDCO Maharashtra Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019 are meant for economically weaker sections (EWS) and low-income groups (LIG). These new houses would be constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) housing scheme.
CIDCO has all the permission in place and till the June end, the tender for construction of 90,000 flats would be opened by July or August. All of these newly constructed houses would be put up for sale through a lottery.

CIDCO Maharashtra Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019
CIDCO Maharashtra will provide around 90,000 affordable houses under this new Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019. The prices of these houses would be 20% to 30% cheaper than those offered by private developers in the open market. Moreover, buyers will get more flexibility in making payment and all the lottery winners can pay for homes as the construction progresses. Just like the previous CIDCO scheme for 14,000 homes, this scheme will also remain hit.
CIDCO Lucky Draw 2019 Scheme has caused a stir in the Mumbai’s real estate market. There is already a demand of 2 lakh homes and supply is almost nil. But the quality and location of CIDCO houses is not as desirable as those homes offered by private developers. Private developer choose sites close to railway stations, markets, schools and thus asks for higher premium amount.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

However, the new CIDCO Maharashtra housing scheme is going to boost development of local infrastructure. Moreover, the CIDCO’s affordable housing scheme will help buyers who cannot afford a private project. As the houses offered by either CIDCO or MHADA are affordable, so every year there are so many applicants for housing lotteries. It is expected that the project would bring much needed correction in an overpriced market.
All the houses provided by CIDCO are cheaper and comes at reasonable rates. In addition to this, there is no cheating, fraud or delay in the housing projects. A buyer feels more confident in buying a government-developed house. In the area, government rates range in the Rs. 4,500 to 5,000 per sq.ft bracket. This ready reckoner rate varies from area to area. CIDCO is selling houses at Rs 6,000 per sq.ft as compared to Rs. 9,000 per sq.ft price of a private developer.

The state govt. will acquire the lands in MMR which includes the state’s capital Mumbai and its satellite towns. The officials will table this new PPP Policy before the cabinet in the next 8 to 10 days.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Maharashtra New Policy for Housing – PPP Model
The draft of the new PPP Policy for MMR comprises of 2 most important features as described below:-

All the land owners who possess a land holding of more than 100 acres and are unable to develop a big project will have to either sell their land to the govt. or partner with the govt. to develop that land.
In case the state govt. acquires the land, then the land owners will get compensation from the govt. as per the existing reckoner rate or can get homes by the state govt.

The state govt. feels the need for this new policy as there are various large land parcels with an area upto 100 to 500 acres in the MMR region where owners does not have finances to develop their land. Moreover, if these owners develop their land into big projects, they can just get an FSI of 1 or at-most 2.5. On these FSI, they also have to pay premium. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

So, govt. is going to bing this new PPP Policy to benefit the owners as well as to provide affordable housing to the poor people. Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority is now selected as the single nodal agency to monitor the affordable housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

This HVDS Scheme will ensure proper power supply to farmers for efficient utilization of agricultural pumps. This govt. scheme will benefit around 2.24 lakh farmers in the state who are still waiting for new power connections.
Mahavitaran – State power distribution utility is going to take a loan of Rs. 2500 crore for HVDS Scheme. Maharashtra govt. will be the guarantor for this loan amount. Now farmers will get high voltage electricity without tripping effects. To reduce electricity losses, govt. will launch “One Farmer One Transformer” Scheme.
At present, Maharashtra govt. provides eight hours electricity supply to farmers on a daily basis. For this, there are approx. 700 feeders. But now, the state govt. has decided to launch High voltage distribution scheme to provide more electricity to farmers. HVDS Scheme will cost Rs. 5048 crore to the state exchequor. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

High Voltage Distribution System – HVDS Scheme
Till date, villages and farms share a common electricity connection for agriculture purposes which does not ensure adequate power supply to farmers. Maharashtra govt. is going to launch One Farmer One Transformer Scheme to provide separate electricity connections for villages and farms. For now, govt. has launched HVDS Scheme whose details are as follows:-

Govt. has approved High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) Scheme to provide electricity connections and to ensure proper power supply to farmers for agriculture.
Now every 2 farmers will share a single transformers through HVDS lines under this scheme.
This scheme will reduce the line losses from 50% to 15% in some places.
Maharashtra govt. will launch this scheme on 15 August 2018 and on the same day, govt. will start providing transformers upto 31 March next year.
In the current scenario, around 10 to 15 farmers receive electricity through 65 to 100 Kilovolt-Ampere (kVA) lines. This leads to low voltage electricity and power tripping due to defects in transformers.
The state govt. has made budgetary allocation of Rs. 600 crore for Marathwada and Vidarbha Regions. Moreover, Maharavitran will also avail loan of Rs. 2500 crore for which state govt. will act as guarantor.
Under HVDS Scheme, the total expenditure for a single agricultural pump is expected to be approx. 2 lakh.

In the past few years, Maharashtra has become self sufficient in electricity and there is no power shortage. Govt. has already achieved 23,100 MW electricity production capacity to provide uninterrupted power supply. With this capacity, there are no complaints on load-shedding for industrialm residential and commercial customers.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

As on 1 April 2018, there are around 45 lakh farmers who have not paid their electricity bills worth Rs. 13,198 crore. So, the state govt. wants them to pay at least Rs 5,000 each to be able to strengthen the transmission system. Even the state govt. has stopped disconnecting electricity connections for the bill defaulters.
As a pro-farmer govt., around 4 lakh farmers have already received agricultural pumps connections in the previous 3 years. Each agricultural connection costs around Rs. 1.5 lakh. So, the state govt. is making all possible efforts to raise the standards of living of poor farmers.

Banks will provide funds and required deposit amount to the flat owners.
For this reason, MHADA and BMC officials will form a Single-Window System which will speed up the process of getting permissions and approvals.
MHADA and Mumbai District Bank will conduct workshops for flat owners to make them aware about the self-redevelopment loan policy and necessary permissions.
Moreover, MHADA authorities along with the civic bodies will create a panel which will consist of architects, consultants and contractors. These members will work in coordination to benefit the flat owners of the housing societies.
This govt. scheme will enable the flat owners to carry out redevelopment of their flats without involvement of any builder. The flat owners can choose any architect, consultant and contractors as per their choice.
Moreover, the builders prove to be a hurdle in the redevelopment process of the flats.

This Self Redevelopment Scheme will facilitate speedy redevelopment process who wants to renovate their homes. As per the initial reports of banks, more than 2000 redevelopment projects are still blocked due to the builder leaving the project mid way.

Previously, BDA collected compounding fees at Rs. 25 / sq. ft. Govt. will now calculate this fees as per the benchmark price fixed by the government.

This policy will bring further transparency in the sand mining business. Department of Mining would launch an online Punjab Sand Portal for sale of sand to all consumers. All the contracts will be granted by auction of mining blocks in strategically established clusters through progressive bidding. 
At Punjab Sand Portal, all transactions / payments will be captured through an online real-time monitoring system. New policy specifies the quantity of sand and gravel which would be called “Annual Concession Quality” which a bidder is allowed to mine in 1 year. 
Both sand and gravel shall not be sold at the mining site for more than Rs. 9 per cubic feet and max. rates linked to a distance will be notified soon including cost of loading of the vehicle.

Punjab New Sand and Gravel Policy – Online Sand Portal to be Launched
As per the reports, it was earlier decided that a new policy would come into force in 2 months after cabinet approval for Punjab State Sand and Gravel Policy 2018 and amendment to Punjab Minor Mineral Rules 2013. Previously, auction process was carried out by the individual mines in Punjab but now the auction will be organized in strategically established clusters and contracts will be given on the basis of progressive bidding. This move will raise the royalty receipt of state exchequer, provide adequate supply at fair price to consumers and curb illegal mining. 
Only registered companies, partnerships, societies, sole proprietorship, individuals and consortia of upto 3 such entities would remain eligible to bid subject to fulfillment of terms and conditions. The average annual turnover of the bidder for the duration of last 3 years ending 31st March must not be less than 50% of reserve price of the mining block for which he is placing bid. In case of consortium, the combined technical and financial capacity of all the members will be considered for eligibility.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Punjab Sand Portal would control the sale of sand to consumers by electronic documentation with modern facility and the daily progress report would be uploaded on the portal. In the new policy, the mining rights of concession quantity of sand and gravel in mining block would be put to bidding through transparent e-auction process. 
Bidder needs to ensure that site managers, JE level officers and software professionals must remain present at all mines. Bidder should obtain or hire the machinery for mining block he plans to bid for and policy contains details of machinery required for different capacity of mines. New policy will specify Annual Concession quantity which is allowed to be mined from a block in a single year.
The concessionaire will identify mines in the allocated block, obtain consent of land owners, arrange for infrastructure requirements before the starting of mining operations. In case the mining is to be done in a river bed, then concessionaire need to intimate Chief Engineer Drainage seven day in advance before a mining activity is to be carried out. This is to be done so that mining doesn’t affect the flow of river or damage embankments. To provide environment & other clearances in a timely manner, Executive Engineer at the Headquarter would act as a nodal authority.
To regularly check overpricing of sand and gravel, a cap has been put on their sale price. Both sand and gravel shall not be sold at the mining site at more than Rs. 9 per cubic feet and max. rates linked to a distance that can be charged for each cubic meter will be notified soon. This price includes cost of loading of the vehicle. Concessionaire will hold the responsibility to dispatch sand and gravel through only those transporters who agrees to transport it at notified or less rates. 
It is mandatory for concessionaire of each block to notify rates of sand on the new portal to be launched by the department. Even the summary of online order and quantity of available sand at mine would be present on the portal. Any person can book online orders through divisional mining office or sub divisional mining office. The state govt. would soon launch android mobile application for this purpose. All vehicles which are used in transportation of sand would also be registered on the sand portal. 
Weighting slips for transportation of sand will contain features of barcodes, QR codes which will be stamped with date & time and vehicles would be tracked with the GPS / RFID tags. All mines will be geo-tagged while performing physical inspections and even the boundaries of mines would be checked using GPS coordinates. This would help in checking whether any mining activity is ongoing outside the permitted area. All the mines which are recently auctioned will continue to operate till their tenure completes.

Under the scheme, the women from below poverty line (BPL) families are benefited through direct benefit transfer. The beneficiary of the scheme will get the amount directly into their bank account. 
According, Bamshah card is a family card which is issued in the name of the woman because she is considered as the head of the family. In addition, the Bhamashah card is mandatory for claiming birth, death and marriage certificates. However, this card has become biggest hurdle to the beneficiaries because they are depriving of getting benefits of schemes like the Prime Minister Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAYG), Mukhyamantri Rajshri Yojana etc.
Initially, the Bhamashah card was not mandatory to avail the benefits of the schemes but the state government made the card mandatory in June 2017. Therefore, that beneficiary has without the card, are excluded. Moreover, under the Bhamashah Yojana, the eligible beneficiary cannot take the credit beyond the limit of Rs. 50,000. Hence, the authorities cannot release the second installment, under PMAYG scheme, which is more than Rs. 50, 000.

In 2016, the Mukhyamantri Rajshri Yojana was launched to encourage girl child education and arrest female foeticide. Under the scheme, a new mother of a girl child is receiving Rs. 2,500 on the completion of one year. In addition, if all vaccinations are done, the second installment of Rs. 2,500 also gets in the account of the mother.
In absence of the Bhamashah card, only 12.55% beneficiaries in Barmer district could get the second installment. In addition, thousands of beneficiaries in Barmer district have been deprived of availing benefits under the PMAG and Rajshri schemes.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

According to the data, about 9,206 beneficiaries received the first installment between June 2016 and October 2016. But the government made the card mandatory in the month of June 2017. Hence, the beneficiary of the first installment couldn’t claim the second installment because they had not the card. 
The data revealed that in absence of the Bhamashah card, the health department did not release the second installment to 8,050 registered beneficiaries in Barmer district. Mere 1,156 (12.55 %) have been able to get the second installment.
PMAY – Gramin
The concerned authority is requesting from people to enroll their name for the Bhamashah card so that they can avail the benefits. Apart from this, PMAYG is a housing scheme which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2015 to provide an affordable house with proper sanitation and power supply.
In the Bhamashah account, the upper credit limit is Rs. 50,000 that’s why authorities didn’t release the second installment of Rs 60,000. Therefore, the central government has ordered to decreased the amount of the second installment from Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 48,000 for the current financial year. 
Moreover, the government has urged to the beneficiaries of previous years to convert their ‘Jan Dhan’ account into the general account. However, the state government has informed that they are not willing to convert the Bhamashah Yojana account into a general account. For this reason, the beneficiaries of PMAYG are still deprived of the second installment because their accounts have under Bhamashah Yojana. 
The chief executive officer at Barmer Zila Parishad has suggested that the beneficiaries get details of another account so that they can release the second installment of Rs. 48000.

The farmers who are replacing their standard motors will receive subsidy amount of Rs. 750 per horsepower from the government. However, motors must be replaced with five-star rated pump.
The interest rates on amount paid for power connections that were cut off has been slashed from 16% to 12% yearly and can be reconnected under this scheme.
If the connection demand note was an issue within five years then the farmers will have to pay Rs. 500 to get their connection.
During the deposit of demand draft, farmers can erect electric lines if the option is available.

According to the govt. notification, farmers who are receiving the subsidy under solar pump sets will not be able to take benefit of second agriculture connection in general category. For them, govt. will soon announce a new separate policy.
It should be noticed here that under the scheme, govt. has given relaxed provisions for martyrs’ families. These family can apply for agricultural connections anytime. Earlier, it was mandatory in the agriculture policy to apply for connection within twelve years of the death or within two years of getting ownership of land.

Environment Clearance was given on 19 December 2019. The main purpose of this scheme is to recharge and raise the ground water levels.
The Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme aims to ensure fresh drinking water supply to all households in the state. The main aim is to provide piped water supply to each family across the Tamil Nadu state. An amount of Rs. 1,000 crore was sanctioned for the project estimated to cost Rs. 1,652 crore. A pipeline is to be created for 1,058 Km and 6 pump houses constructed.
A total of 1,048 water bodies would benefit from the Athikadavu Avinashi Scheme to provide irrigation facilities to people.

Tamil Nadu Free Laptop Distribution Scheme 2019
In the recent proposal for financial year 2018-2019, govt. has allocated Rs. 758 crore (similar to previous year) for Free Laptop Distribution Scheme. Moreover from this year, education dept. has prepared proposal to include students of class IX and X class in the free laptop scheme and forward it to the central government for financial approval. Previously, this TN free laptop computer scheme was for class XI, XII and college students whose details can be checked at http://117.239.70.115/e2s/. 
The state govt. has so far distributed around 38 lakh free computers under TN free laptop distribution scheme. The state govt. is working out on the total financial cost of the scheme for FY 2019. The issues in laptop scheme goes well beyond financial burden. one of the issue is that if a student gets laptop in class 9 or 10th, then is there a need to give them another laptop in class 11th and class 12th which would reduce financial burden.

TN Free Laptop Computer Scheme – Background
In the current academic year, Lenovo which is a computer manufacturing company has won the tender to distribute 15.66 lakh laptops each at the cost of 10,000 plus tax. As per the school education dept. policy note, govt. has allotted Rs. 758 crore for TN Free Laptop Distribution Scheme 2019. School education authorities are saying this scheme as more than financial burden but there are other issues in this scheme.
This free laptop computer scheme has problems in granting tender, sale of laptops in grey market and poor configuration. In the previous year, same amount was allocated for laptops but only 42,000 students out of 5.3 lakh beneficiaries got these laptops due to the death of former CM Jayalalithaa. This means that the new announcement will provide laptops to an additional 9.6 lakh students of class 9th and 10th. 
Moreover, the laptop computers which would be given to the students has only basic software. Even though, there is an option to install additional features, but the short capacity and speed of laptop does not support it. The laptops could only be used to read or write and nothing else could be done. These laptops are useful for those who are in desperate need of one.
There is a major shortage of computer teachers in high schools and if it continues so, then point of distributing laptops will serve no purpose. For more details, visit the official ELCOT website at http://117.239.70.115/e2s/. Even if the laptops would be provided to students, then who will teach them to use these computers. The high school students studies computer science only as a theory lesson in Science subject.

Govt. will update all the land transactions on this website on a daily basis. People can also use this information for sale and purchase of land. For this reason, govt. has created an IT wing to update this info.
Revenue department will take over the process of land administration and records maintenance.
This will bring a new transparent and corruption free “Land and Reforms Based Registration Policy”.
On 11 March 2018, govt. will implement an Input Subsidy Scheme and also distribute new passbooks to Telangana Farmers.
KCR also announced that all the farmers can avail this registration facility at each Mandal Office.
Furthermore for eliminating corruption, govt. will introduce new reforms – put an end to fake documents for Registration, Sale and Purchase of lands. In addition to this, process of Land Records Maintenance will also get introduced.

This will ease down the process for farmers and other people. Now, people don’t have to make unnecessary visits to the govt. offices. They shall come to the registration office only once which will further eradicate corruption. Accordingly, govt. will strengthen land records maintenance and other reforms through the official website Dharani which will record each transaction.

Yogi Adityanath decides to put up 1 lakh such cows for public adoption. The state govt. will transfer Rs. 900 per month to bank account of willing persons who take home a cow.
Each such animal which is adopted would be ear-tagged for identity purposes under UP CM Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. Earlier in 2019, farmers in UP had taken up arms and protested over stray cattle destroying their fields. This is an aftermath of decision of ban on illegal slaughter of cattle in Uttar Pradesh.
There were various instances of farmers locking up stray cattle in govt. schools and offices which led to UP govt. to order opening of new cow shelters in every district. The UP govt. is paying Rs. 900 every month to upkeep each cattle to cow shelters too.

Yogi Govt. to Pay Rs. 30 / Day on Adopting Stray Cattle
As the cow shelters are overflowing with more than 10 to 12 lakh cattle and there are reports of cows dying due to neglect. So, UP govt. has approved a new Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. In this scheme, all the willing farmers, dairy farmers or common people can adopt a cow from existing shelters and take animal home.
In the 1st phase of adopting stray cattle scheme, govt. will hand over 1 lakh cattle to such members of public. UP govt. is going to transfer Rs. 900 per month to bank account of each such farmer for up-keep and nutrition of animal. The District Magistrates are going to identify such “willing adopters”. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The state govt. of Uttar Pradesh will spend Rs. 109 crore on this exercise annually. In order to avail the scheme benefits, person who adopts the animal cannot sell or let loose / abandon the animal. The UP govt. will setup committee in each district to monitor exercise and each such animal handed over would be ear tagged. This ear tagging is to be done for identity and subsequent monitoring.
The UP government has the “potential to create employment and increase social participation”. This would increase the income of farmers and would reduce the extent of stray cattle in UP. In the subsequent phases, more cow can be put up for adoption depending upon initial success.

Road Safety Council is working on encouraging people to help victims of accident.

UP Good Samaritan Scheme 2019 by Yogi Adityanath
After an increase in the number of road accidents in UP, Yogi Adityanath govt. works on a new policy to provide cash incentives to good samaritans. All those people who comes forward to help and take injured people to hospitals for treatment will get Rs. 2,000. The proposal for Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme has been sent and the scheme is expected to start in the next 2 or 3 months.
Previously, the state govt. has formulated policy to protect Good Samaritan which is existing since January 2016, but it is not enough. This move of providing Rs. 2,000 will minimize deaths from road accidents and make medical assistance available to victims within the crucial golden hour (1st hour after accident).


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Bystanders, who assist road accident victims already enjoys legal protection from police and hospital questioning and other legal hassles under the good Samaritan law. This law was made by the central government made after Supreme Court judgment in 2014.
Delhi, Gujarat, Odisha, Karnataka and Maharashtra already have Good Samaritan Scheme. Every state follows a different procedure to provide cash incentives to volunteers, so UP govt. has to lay down a procedure before official launch of scheme. The state govt. is expected to earmark Rs. 50 lakh for funding the Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme. 
However, the money will come from the Road Safety Fund and not the state govt’s budget. UP has lesser number of road accidents but the highest number of deaths. The major reason is that people doesn’t assist victims and a large number of injured persons lacks timely hospitalization. Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme in UP will encourage and motivate volunteers to help the injured ones.
